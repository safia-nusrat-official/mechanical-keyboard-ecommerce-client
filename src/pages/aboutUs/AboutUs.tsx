            <p className="text-zinc-600 mt-2">
              KeyWizards was founded in 2020 by a group of keyboard enthusiasts
              who were tired of the limited options available in the market.
              What started as a hobby turned into a passion project, and soon,
              KeyWizards was born. From our humble beginnings in Pennsylvania,
              we've grown into a global community of keyboard lovers. Our
              journey has been fueled by a dedication to quality, innovation,
              and customer satisfaction.
